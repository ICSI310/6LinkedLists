Let's make a list of what we think we need?

* track time

How can we approach tracking time?
-while reading file
-after file done

loop: for, while
double
increment time

Give me at least 3 ways to track/increment time

* 2. add the amount of time that passed for capturing each hero

* 3. track time by when the sharks need to eat

How should we deal with time variable(s)?


add the amount of time that passed for capturing each hero

Algorithm for printing just lines about capturing heroes + time elapsed?

What happens when we bring a double into a class as an arg?








* Create a method prompting the list to act as a queue or stack depending on whether nemesis has been reached?

* A way to tell if we should be in stack vs. queue

* track when sharks need to eat
